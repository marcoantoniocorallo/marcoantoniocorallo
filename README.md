:man_technologist: I'm a computer scientist with a strong curiosity about the world, the universe and everything that happens inside it. :sparkles:

:mortar_board:  I'm a MSc student @ [UniPi](https://di.unipi.it/en/), where I'm studying security and verification, by means of both *theoretical CS* and *cybersecurity* courses.

🌱 I'm currently learning how to develop smart contracts while improving my skills as a CTF player.

:hammer:    In my free time, I'm currently working on a simple framework for _model checking_ in Rust

🚀 My latest (public) projects are mainly programming language related:
- [MicroC](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/MicroC): an LLVM-based compiler for a sublanguage of C;
- [EsoCaml](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/EsoCaml): an [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) front-end for a simple functional language;
- [Trustee](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Trustee): an extension for [Fhree](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Fhree) for supporting security primitives, _taint analysis_ and information flow to prevent data leaks;
