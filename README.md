:man_technologist: I'm a computer scientist with a strong curiosity about the world, the universe and everything that happens inside it. :sparkles:

:mortar_board:  I'm a MSc student @ [UniPi](https://di.unipi.it/en/), where I'm attending both *theoretical CS* and *cybersecurity-oriented* courses, in order to become an expert of systems security and verification;

👨‍💻 I’m currently working on
  - an [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) front-end for [Fhree](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Fhree);

🌱 I’m currently learning techniques for reasoning on models of computation, the development of smart contracts and the evaluation and management of ICT risks;

🚀 My latest (public) projects:
- [Fhree](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Fhree): a small strongly typed functional language;
- [JobScheduler](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/JobScheduler-Framework): a simple framework that implements *Inversion of Control* providing the functionalities of a job scheduler;
- [8Puzzle](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Eight-Puzzle): a simple game built using jbeans and events;
- [CKC](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/concurrent-KColoring): a concurrent [k-coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Exact_algorithms) solver, developed with [Fred-ef](https://github.com/Fred-ef).
