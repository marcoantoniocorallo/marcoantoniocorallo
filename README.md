:man_technologist: I'm a computer scientist with a strong curiosity about the world, the universe and everything that happens inside it. :sparkles:

:mortar_board:  I'm a MSc student @ [UniPi](https://di.unipi.it/en/), where I'm studying security and verification, by means of both *theoretical CS* and *cybersecurity* courses.

:hammer: In my free time, I'm currently working on a simple framework for _model checking_ written in Rust.

ðŸš€ My latest (public) projects:
- [MicroC](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/MicroC): an LLVM-based compiler for a sublanguage of C;
- [Mastermind on Blockchain](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Mastermind-on-Blockchain): an implementation of the Mastermind board game on the Ethereum Blockchain;
- [Trustee](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Trustee): an extension for [Fhree](https://github.com/marcoantoniocorallo/Fhree) for supporting security primitives, _taint analysis_ and information flow to prevent data leaks;
